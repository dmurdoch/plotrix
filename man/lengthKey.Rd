\title{Key for interpreting lengths in a plot}
\description{Key for interpreting lengths in a plot}
\usage{
 lengthKey(x,y,tickpos,scale)
}
\arguments{
 \item{x,y}{The position of the left end of the key in user units.}
 \item{tickpos}{The labels that will appear above the key.}
 \item{scale}{A value that will scale the length of the key.}
}
\value{nil}
\details{
 \samp{lengthKey} displays a line with tick marks and the values in
 \samp{tickpos} above those tickmarks. It is useful when line segments
 on a plot represent numeric values. Note that if the plot does not have
 a 1:1 aspect ratio, a length key is usually misleading.

 # manufacture a matrix of orientations in radians
